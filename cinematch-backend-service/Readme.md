# Backend services

### For the contenerized app :
```shell
    .\install.ps1
```
It will build common-module then other container will be able to import it as a dependency

### For the local app :

You may need to reset hard coded url in the code. Don't hesitate to use ctrl + f to find where it may be used

The application.properties file contains commented line for use of the app without docker.

To run the app locally, Open the `cinematch-backend-service` in intellij as a project.
